                <li>The Timline of HTML</li>
                    <li>1994- HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS.</li> 
                   <li> 1996- The first version of CSS was invented.</li>
                   <li> 1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, fot instead of being a single monolithic specification, it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules. Each module dealt with a relatively small subset of the overall specification, and either added new features or refined and extended existing features. All additions and enhancements to the specification were written in order to be backward-compatible with older versions of CSS.
                     2011- CSS 2.1 was released, which fixed the errors found in CSS </li>
