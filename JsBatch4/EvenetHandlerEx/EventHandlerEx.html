        The concept of smart campus emerged to promote student learning through a wide variety of advanced technologies such as data mining and artificial intelligence. These technologies are technically enabled with the help of the under lying smart campus infrastructure which is categorized into different layers such as the sensing layer, network layer, and computing layer. One of the effective technologies in smart campus is the Internet of Things (IOT) which forms the sensing layer and involves a wide range of applications in different aspects related to smart buildings, smart furniture, and smart wear able sensors. 
       The sensing layer enables the computing layer which is in charge of making decisions based on the various needs of learners that can be identified by processing data related to student attendance, participation, performance, and health. 
       Here, it is worth to mention that the goal of implementing such technologies in the context of smart campus is not only to enhance the technical capabilities, but more importantly to fuse these technologies with the educational process in order to establish an efficient student centered learning environment.
        Early prediction of students performance helps instructors to identify the learning weaknesses at early stages and to make proactive steps that help to engage students and enhance the learning process. Besides, the integration of machine learning and IOT in the information system of smart campus can assist in predicting student attendance which in turn helps to quantify the occupancy of classrooms and hence to optimize class room utilization, air conditioning performance, and energy efficiency.
